# Dawremi

Dawremi (pronounced do-re-mi) is a code-based Digital Audio Workstation.

This project kinda works, but is generally in an early stage, and documentation and guides are non-existant. I'll try to improve this once the API stabilizes. For the time being, you can look through the examples or reading through the autogenerated docs, which should be somewhat understandable. But then again, I'm the one who wrote the code, if I didn't think it's understandable we would have a problem.

## Getting started

Then add this repo as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
dawremi = { git = "https://github.com/guimcaballero/dawremi" }
```

Copy the `assets` folder into your project's root folder, so you can access preadded samples and other needed assets. You can get it easily with `svn` with:

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/guimcaballero/dawremi/trunk/assets
```

Then, making a new song is easy! You have to create a new struct using the `song!()` macro, and then implement the `Song` trait for that struct. The following is a demo song, copied from `examples/demo_song.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate dawremi;
use dawremi::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut song = DemoSong::default();
    // Uncomment the following line to play the song through your speakers
    // song.play().expect("Unable to play song");
}

song!(DemoSong,);

impl Song for DemoSong {
    /// Display name for the song
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "Demo song"
    }

    /// Song's beats per minute
    fn bpm(&self) -> usize {
        120
    }

    /// Song's duration (in samples)
    fn duration(&self) -> Option<usize> {
        // We're using the beats helper function that converts 16 beats to the number of samples to take
        Some(self.beats(16.))
    }

    /// List of tracks on this song. Each track is just a list of samples (Vec<Frame>)
    /// All of the tracks will be mixed equally
    fn tracks(&mut self) -> Vec<Vec<Frame>> {
        vec![self.plucked_track(), self.other_track()]
    }
}

impl DemoSong {
    /// This is a track
    fn plucked_track(&self) -> Vec<Frame> {
        // We ue a macro to play a sequence of notes. Returns a Vec<Frame>
        sequence!(
            self,
            // The lenght of one note in beats
            len: 1.,
            // The note representation we want to use. GuitarFretboard simulates a guitar tab,
            // using the first letter as the string, and the number as the finger position
            // L is the low e string
            note: GuitarFretboard,
            // The function we want to use to generate the sound
            fun: |note| self.plucked(note, InitialBurstType::Triangle(2, 3)),

            // List of notes. Underscores signal silences
            L5 L5 _ L8 L8 _ L1 L1 _ L4 L4
        )
        // We can chain another sequence
        .chain(sequence!(
            self,
            len: 1., note: GuitarFretboard,
            fun: |note| self.plucked(note, InitialBurstType::DoubleTriangle),

            L5 L5 _ L8 L8 _ L1 L1 _ L4 L4
        ))
    }

    /// This is a helper function
    fn plucked(&self, frequency: impl Into<Frequency>, burst: InitialBurstType) -> Synth {
        Synth::new(
            Box::new(Plucked::new(
                burst,
                frequency.into(),
                self.get_sample_rate(),
            )),
            self.get_sample_rate(),
        )
    }

    fn other_track(&mut self) -> Vec<Frame> {
        // We can also make a list of notes and manipulate it.
        let notes1: Vec<Vec<Note>> = {
            use Note::*;
            // This is equivalent to vec![vec!(A4, C4), vec!(A5), vec!(A6), vec!(), vec!(A6)]
            // A4 and C4 will be played together, followed by A5, then A6, then a silence, then A6
            note_list![[A4, C4], A5, A6, _, A6]
        };

        // `generate` will transform the notes into sounds
        let sound1 = notes1.generate(
            // Function to use to generate the audio
            &|note, length| {
                self.plucked(note, InitialBurstType::Triangle(2, 3))
                    .take_samples(length)
            },
            // Length of each note
            self.beats(1.),
        );

        // Generate sounds one octave higher
        let sound2 = notes1
            // We can map over the notes
            .map_notes(Note::up_an_octave)
            .generate(
                &|note, length| {
                    self.plucked(note, InitialBurstType::Triangle(2, 3))
                        .take_samples(length)
                },
                self.beats(1.),
            );

        // We can use other types of notes too
        let bass = {
            use GuitarFretboard::*;
            note_list![L5, L5, _, L8, L8, _, L1, L1, _, L4, L4,]
        }
        .generate(
            &|note, length| {
                self.plucked(note, InitialBurstType::Sine)
                    .take_samples(length)
            },
            self.beats(1.),
        );

        // We then joing the subtracks into one
        join_tracks(vec![sound1, sound2, bass])
            // We can also add effects to the whole track, like Reverb (using convolution)
            .effect(&Convolution::new(
                self.sound(Reverb::LargeLongEchoHall.into()),
            ))
            // Or volume
            .effect(&Volume {
                mult: Automation::Const(0.5),
            })
    }
}
```

## Importing assets

If you would like to use external sounds with Dawremi, but don't like to use paths as a string, you can add build script to autogenerate enums for files inside folders. Create a file called `build.rs`:

```no_run
fn main() {
    dawremi::prelude::generate_sound_enums(vec!["path/to/assets"]);
}
```

and add `dawremi` to your `build-dependencies` section in `Cargo.toml`. You can pass as many different folders as you want to `generate_sound_enums`.

This is implemented very naively currently, so there's a high probability of it breaking if you do anything complex (Contributions are welcome!). Specifically, if you have two folders named the same, it'll fail to compile.

For example, if you have a folder like the following:

```ignore
assets/internal/reverbs
├── block_inside.wav
├── bottle_hall.wav
├── cement_block2.wav
├── cement_blocks1.wav
├── chateau_de_logne.wav
├── conic_long_echo_hall.wav
├── deep_space.wav
└── vocal_duo.wav
```

The following enum will be generated:

```rust
pub enum Reverb {
    BlockInside,
    BottleHall,
    CementBlock2,
    CementBlocks1,
    ChateauDeLogne,
    ConicLongEchoHall,
    DeepSpace,
    VocalDuo,
}
```

Which will implement `Into<Sound>`, so you can do `self.sound(Rever::VocalDuo.into())` in a song.

Finally, call `include_sound_enums!()` from somewhere in you crate:

```ignore
#[macro_use]
extern crate dawremi;

dawremi::include_sound_enums!();

fn main() {
    // Something here
}
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires a Rust version equal or superior to `1.51`. ~~const generics go brrrrrr~~

## Contributing

If you are using the library and find any bug/problem, please open an issue! I'm focusing most of my time on developing the library instead of using it, so there's probably a lot of stuff I haven't caught yet.

Contributions are welcome, but please do open an issue before starting to code anything, as I might not accept your PR for whatever reason, and I don't want anyone wasting work.
